These files are various Abbyy FR documents.

The naming convention is currently 
three digits for the primary file identification (000, 001, 002) 
dash
the last page added to the file

Future files should be named to include a range of pages:
001_015_0150 where this file contains pages 15 through 150

As these were initial test run files and they all start with page 1, I did not adopt this at this stage.

As of this writing:
bodin_latin_000_363 is a master Abbyy FR document with pages 1 through 363 included and zoned. A few pages are read, but not verified. 

bodin_latin_001_363 is a file derived from the above but with pages 18 through 25 verified.
bodin_latin_002_363 is a file derived from the first listed but with pages 25 and 27 through 30 verified.

All of the above were last modified May 31, 2013.

Bodin_Latin.fbt is the pattern file for this manuscript and also includes the Abbyy user language Latin_Renaissance which is based on Abbyy Latin.
